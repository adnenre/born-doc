## System Requirements

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm, pnpm, or yarn

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git
cd your-project
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`. You can now open your browser and see your documentation site in action.

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `.next` directory. You can then deploy this to your hosting provider of choice.
