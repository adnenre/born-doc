# Tip Component

The `Tip` component is a built-in MDX component that allows you to highlight important information for the reader. It's great for drawing attention to best practices, suggestions, or anything you want the user to take special note of.

## Usage

To use the `Tip` component, you can embed it directly into your `.mdx` files.

```mdx
<Tip>
  This is an important piece of information that you should pay attention to.
  You can include **markdown** right inside of it!
</Tip>
```

## Example

<Tip>
  This is an important piece of information that you should pay attention to.
  You can include **markdown** right inside of it!
</Tip>
